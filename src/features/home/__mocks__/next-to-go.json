Has found winning form and is worth following up. BAKERU (4) did a great job to score by a dominant margin over this course and distance last start in a much improved run. Must raise the bar but another win beckons. MEISHO MAKOMO (1) did a great job to score by half a length over this course and distance last start in a far better effort. Taking on a better line-up this time but he is up to the challenge. CIRCULAR RING (3) finished seventh last time in a disappointing performance.

SUBRISING (6) comes out of the same race as BEAUTY RISING where she was a lot less fancied and made less of an impression. But that was a debut effort and there is obviously an opinion of the filly considering she got thrown straight in the deep-end. Gets Damien Oliver on. Has to be considered. CELESTIAL STORM (7) improved many lengths in her second-up efforts chasing gamely into the placings on the Hillside surface. Open to further improvement. FOREVER MORE (3) was an eye-catcher on debut at Bendigo when flashing home to nab a placing. Drawn to settle closer to the action this time and could be too strong for them late. Keep safe.",

He should be winning again. BEARTASTIC WRITER (10) had a win at Broken Hill two runs ago before finishing runner up at his latest appearance over 1790m at this track, beaten 25 metres. Hard to know where he gets from this slightly awkward draw. Good enough to take out a race like this. STORM STRIDE (9) has to come into calculations on the back of some strong recent form, most recently when second at this track over 1790m. Must be included. HEADBANGER (11) was out of the money two starts ago then he broke and finished a long last over 1790m at this track. He has a tough draw but can improve sharply in this field.",
